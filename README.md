## Usage
(Content in development. No completeness guaranteed)
* For the data-fetching code to run, you must obtain an API key from openstates.org first.
* To run the code, in your terminal, type `py openstates_api.py <api-key> <search-keyword>`. No worries, though, if you forget the syntax - you can simply type `py openstates_api.py` and the error message displayed will guide you.
* You may go into the code and customize other paramters, like `state` (currently set to New York), `search_window` (currently set to the current legislative session), and `type` (currently set to bill, but there are other kinds of legislatives e.g. resolution, joint resolution, concurrent resolutoin, constitutional amendment).
